> Subjectively criticizing the styles of individual speakers rather than
objectively addressing the substance of the topic at hand doesn't get you
very far; not just at MIT but most anywhere else you happen to go in life.

You asked why there was such a big hoo-hah, and so much negativity, about
what should be a pretty interesting, acceptable discussion. Several people
gave (more or less) the same answer. Just because you don't like the
answer, and it can't be proven in Mathematica, doesn't make it any less
valid. Entire segments of society have their careers are built upon
subjective matters of style!

The best way of dealing with feelings is to talk about them, *not* to
bottle them up and pretend to be a vulcan. When *other* people are upset,
telling them "you shouldn't be upset, stop being so illogical or you won't
go anywhere in life" is usually not the way to deal with it.
